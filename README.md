# IMDB-Reviews-Analysis
In this project, a dataset containing positive and negative viewer opinions taken from the IMDB website was used and a model that predicts whether viewer opinions are positive or negative was targeted.
In the dataset consisting of 50000 observations, the distribution of the number of observations from positive and negative categories is equal and is not present in the data.

Two separate models were created for modeling by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
